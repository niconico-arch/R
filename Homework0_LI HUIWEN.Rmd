## Who am I?  
Hello World! My name is LI HUIWEN. I'm a full-time master student majoring in Financial Mathematics in HKUST. 

## Where am I from?  
__Wuyuan__, is a small town in the northeast of Jiangxi province in China, boardering two other provinces of Zhejiang and Anhui. It is famous for the stunning scenaries and well-protected historical architecture. Houses in the town are mostly in Hui style architecture with black tiles and white walls. It is quiet and beautiful, surrounded by mountains and river. Growing up in the small town, I enjoy connecting with nature and truely appreciate all resources we are granted.
